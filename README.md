# RUST_projects
Hi everyone,

Welcome to my Github! :)

My name is Jackie Pham, currently I am working as Product Manager for a Blockchain company. We do crypto wallet, KYC, R&D, etc. Graduated Computer Science many years ago, I have always “entertained” myself with the idea of writing my own codes. During my various encounters with IOHK - the institute that is building protocol for Cardano project, RUST is mentioned many times as a fast and light language. So that is why I am here…

I feel privileged that there are many awesome developers in my current company who were disrupted countlessly by me during the creation of these codes… and still being so nice and patient.

And I thank you all for your feedback. It is never too late to be a Rustacean.. Or so I heard :)

Saigon 16th August,

JP.
